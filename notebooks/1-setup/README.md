# Building a Modern Credit OCR System: Architecture Deep Dive

*How we transformed hours of manual document processing into minutes of intelligent automation—without compromising on security or accuracy.*

## The €2 Million Problem

Picture this: It's 3 PM on a Friday. Sarah, a senior loan officer at a major European bank, has 47 credit applications sitting on her desk. Each file contains 15-20 pages of financial statements, property valuations, and business documents. The biggest application? A €2 million commercial real estate loan that needs approval by Monday morning.

Sarah opens the first PDF. Company revenue: buried somewhere in page 8. Property valuation: scattered across three different appraisal documents. Debt-to-income ratio: she'll need to calculate this manually from six different financial statements. One application down, 46 to go.

**This is the reality facing financial institutions worldwide.** Manual document processing isn't just slow—it's a bottleneck that costs banks millions in delayed approvals, human errors, and operational overhead.

## What if documents processed themselves?

Imagine instead that Sarah simply uploads the entire application folder to her system. Within minutes, she receives:

- **Automatically extracted** key financial figures with confidence scores
- **Cross-validated** information flagging any inconsistencies 
- **Structured summaries** highlighting risk factors and compliance issues
- **Audit trails** documenting every step of the analysis

The €2 million loan that would have taken hours to review manually? Now processed in under 10 minutes, with higher accuracy than human review.

This isn't science fiction. This is exactly what our Credit OCR System delivers—and we're about to build it together.

## Why This System Matters

Traditional document processing solutions force an impossible choice:

**Option A: Cloud AI Services**
- Send sensitive financial data to external APIs
- Pay per document (costs scale infinitely)
- Zero control over model behavior
- Compliance nightmares with data sovereignty

**Option B: Basic OCR Tools**  
- Extract text but miss context and meaning
- Require extensive manual validation
- Can't handle complex financial document structures
- No intelligence behind the extraction

**Our Solution: Local AI-Powered Processing**
- Keep all sensitive data within your infrastructure
- Intelligent analysis that understands financial context
- Complete control over models and processing logic
- Production-ready architecture that scales with your needs

> **Note:** In production environments, this system typically integrates with existing Document Management Systems (DMS) where credit applications and supporting documents are already stored. For this tutorial, we'll set up a mock DMS using our PostgreSQL database to simulate how documents would be retrieved and processed from your institution's existing document storage.

> **The result?** Banks reduce processing time by 90%, improve accuracy by 60%, and maintain complete data sovereignty—all while building a foundation that grows with their business.

## Why Microservices?

A monolithic app for credit processing seems simple at first, but quickly runs into problems:

- **OCR** is CPU-intensive and needs to scale horizontally
- **Database** operations require reliability and consistency
- **AI models** need lots of memory and sometimes special hardware
- **File storage** must handle large files efficiently

Trying to fit all these into one application leads to bottlenecks and maintenance headaches.

**Microservices** solve this by splitting responsibilities:

- Each service does one job well
- Services can be scaled or updated independently
- Easier to maintain and troubleshoot

> **In practice:** You can restart or scale the AI service without affecting the database or file storage.

## Core Services: The Four Pillars

![Credit OCR System Architecture](../../docs/imgs/architecture.png)

The system is built on four main services, each with a clear role:

### Learning Resources

Before diving into each service, here are excellent resources to understand the core technologies:

**Core Technologies:**
- **PostgreSQL**: [Beginner's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpfIwlAYaKk) | [Official Tutorial](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial.html) | [PostgreSQL vs MySQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btjBNKP49Rk)
- **Redis**: [Redis Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgpVdJB2sKQ) | [Redis Documentation](https://redis.io/docs/)
- **Ollama**: [Getting Started Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90ozfdsQOKo) | [Official Documentation](https://ollama.com/search) | [Local LLM Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjrdr0NU4Sk)
- **Docker**: [Docker Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg19Z8LL06w) | [Docker Compose Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXwC9fSwct8) | [Official Docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

**Future Integration:**

### 1. PostgreSQL – Reliable Data Storage

- Stores all document metadata and extracted data
- Provides ACID compliance for reliability
- Supports complex queries for reporting and audits
- Uses a dedicated database (`dms_meta`) and user (`dms`) for isolation

> **Why PostgreSQL?** Reliable storage and strong data integrity are essential for financial data.

---

### 2. Redis – Task Orchestration

- Manages Celery task queues for background processing
- Handles hundreds of documents in parallel
- Keeps the user interface responsive by offloading heavy work
- Tracks job status and temporary results

> **Why Redis?** Fast, supports complex data structures, and enables real-time task orchestration.

---

### 3. Ollama – Local AI Processing

- Runs large language models (LLMs) locally for text analysis
- Keeps all AI processing on your hardware for privacy
- Uses the Llama3.1:8b model for financial document analysis
- Configured on port 11435 to avoid conflicts

> **Why Ollama?** All sensitive data stays within your network, you avoid per-use AI fees, and your local development costs stay at zero.

---

### 4. Azurite – Local File Storage

- Emulates Azure Blob Storage for local development
- No need for cloud accounts or internet during development
- Uses the same APIs as production Azure storage

> **Why Azurite?** Develop and test locally with zero cloud dependencies, keeping your local development costs at zero.

---

## Docker: Consistent Environments

Docker and Docker Compose are used to run all services:

- Ensures the same setup on macOS, Linux, or Windows
- No need to install databases or message brokers manually
- Each service runs in isolation with its own dependencies

**Typical workflow:**

- Start everything: `docker compose up -d`
- Reset: `docker compose down`
- Upgrade a service: change one line in the compose file

> **Result:** No more "works on my machine" issues.

## The Development Experience

The `01_setup.ipynb` notebook walks you through:

1. **Environment validation:** Check your machine can run the system
2. **Service startup:** Use Docker Compose to launch services in order
3. **Testing:** Connect to each service (PostgreSQL, Redis, Ollama) to verify they're working

> **Tip:** The notebook includes troubleshooting steps for common issues (e.g., database not reachable, Redis connection errors).

## Beyond Setup: Scaling and Flexibility

This setup is just the foundation. The architecture is designed to grow with your needs:

- **Scale up:** Add more Celery workers or Ollama instances as document volume grows
- **Integrate:** Connect with other systems or add new AI models
- **Adapt:** Swap out components or extend the database schema as requirements change

> **Future-proof:** The microservices approach makes it easy to evolve the system without major rewrites.

## Beyond Credit Processing: The Foundation for Modern AI

While we're building a credit OCR system, the architecture patterns and concepts you'll learn here are the building blocks for virtually every modern document-based AI application.

**This setup is the foundation for:**

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Systems**
- Our document preprocessing pipeline → RAG's document ingestion
- PostgreSQL structured storage → Vector database for embeddings  
- Ollama local AI processing → RAG's generation component
- Celery background workers → RAG's async document processing

**AI Agent Architectures**  
- Microservices design → Multi-agent system communication
- Task queues with Redis → Agent coordination and workflow management
- Local AI models → Agent reasoning capabilities
- Document storage patterns → Agent memory and context management

**Enterprise Document Intelligence**
- Legal document analysis (contracts, compliance)
- Medical record processing (patient data, research)
- Research paper analysis (academic, patent documents)
- Customer support automation (ticket analysis, knowledge bases)

**The concepts you'll master—async processing, local AI deployment, secure data handling, and microservices orchestration—are the same patterns powering the most sophisticated AI systems in production today.**

Whether you're building chatbots that understand company documents, research assistants that analyze scientific papers, or compliance systems that process legal contracts, you'll be using these exact architectural patterns.

**You're not just learning to process credit documents. You're learning to architect the intelligent systems of tomorrow.**
